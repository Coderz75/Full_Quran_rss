# Quran RSS

Due to the lack of RSS feeds with the translation of the Quran, this project is intended to use a quick python parser to parse a quran translation into a simple RSS feed. 

Translation was aquired from [https://tanzil.net/trans/](https://tanzil.net/trans/), and the original file is [en.sahih.xml](en.sahih.xml)

The final result file is [quran_rss.xml](quran_rss.xml)
